# MMEngine
Senior Sem 2017.

The goal of this project is to create a 3D game engine that would make the process of creating a game faster as it would serve as a starting point. It would provide an abstraction of the OpenGL API allowing  for the creation of a 3D scene, the loading in 3D meshes, and the mapping of textures. It would also handle the world transformations of a camera and the transformation of 3D objects with simple function calls. And lastly it would provide a simple physics library for creating bounding boxes around 3D objects and detect collision. This would then allow for a basic game to be made while laying the groundwork core systems to continue development on and expand.
