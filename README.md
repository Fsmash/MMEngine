# MMEngine
Senior Sem 2017.

MMEngine is a 3D Game Engine that makes the process of creating a game faster as it serves as a starting point. It provides an abstraction of the OpenGL API allowing for the creation of a 3D scene, the loading in of 3D meshes, and the mapping of textures. It also handles the world transformations of a camera and the transformation of 3D objects with simple function calls. And lastly it provides a simple physics library for creating bounding boxes around 3D objects and detect collision. This allows for a basic game to be made while laying the groundwork for core systems to later be developed upon and expanded.
